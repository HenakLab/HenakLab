Welcome to the Henak Lab Github Repository!

Our research vision is to drive fundamental knowledge generation and tool development to improve quality of life, specifically focused on the burden of musculoskeletal diseases in humans and animals.

**About** 

Mechanical loading plays an important role in the initiation and progression of orthopedic diseases such as osteoarthritis.  Despite their growing economic burden and negative impact on patientsâ€™ quality of life, effective methods of predicting, delaying, preventing or reversing most orthopedic diseases have not been established.  While joint-scale mechanical causes of disease are largely understood, tissue-level stress and strain thresholds that cause tissue damage are lacking.  Knowledge of the effects of tissue-level mechanics would provide the basis for predicting when and where tissue damage will occur under arbitrary loading conditions, ultimately improving our understanding of orthopedic diseases and improving the efficacy of treatment.  Establishing tissue-level mechanics that cause failure in orthopedic tissues has remained elusive due to the short time- and length-scales of interest. Thus, the central hypothesis of the Henak Lab is that the tissue-scale mechanical environment can be used to understand and predict orthopedic diseases.  To address this hypothesis, the Henak Lab uses a combination of multiscale experimental and computational techniques.

**Research**

In the Henak Lab, we study orthopedic biomechanics and mechanobiology, with a core hypothesis that the microscale mechanical environment can be used to predict, delay, and prevent orthopedic diseases.  Our current research is focused on three central themes:  (1) failure in orthopedic tissues; (2) evaluation of material behavior; and (3) regeneration and repair.

_Failure in Orthopedic Tissues_

Orthopedic tissues are predominantly load-bearing, so understanding mechanically-mediated failure is important.  Current projects in this area include:  fracture across loading rates, cartilage-cartilage fatigue loading, and computationally-predicted bone fracture risk.

_Evaluation of Material Behavior_

Material behavior of orthopedic tissues is indicative of tissue health and can be used to build subject-specific computational models.  Current projects in this area include:  MR-based non-invasive estimation of cartilage material properties, characterization of cartilage material behavior from pigs raised under different dietary conditions, spatial heterogeneity in the material behavior of dog teeth, and poroviscoelastic energy dissipation in cartilage.

_Regeneration and Repair_

Regeneration and repair is key to overcoming the failure studied in theme one, but many orthopedic tissues are relatively hindered in this regard due to challenging mechanical environments coupled with low cell density and hypovascularization.  Ultimately, we want to understand and manipulate regeneration and repair following injury as a means to improve patient outcomes.  Current projects in this area include:  short-term metabolic response to mechanical stimuli, cartilage-cartilage integration, and maturity-dependent changes in metabolism.
